### /map CSS

The map is 1000px

### /article CSS
At full width, map has a sidebar, here is the CSS to deal with this.

### Responsive CSS
Take a look at [the CSS]() code in order to familarize yourself with what I'm doing there. Feel free to edit, add, or update what I have. I'm primarily doing 3 things:
* Adjusting map height so that, once you reach the map, it does not extend below the bottom of the screen. (Most important)
* Optional: Turn on the scroll-area on the right to allow to scroll through the map without it zooming (on a touch device, zooming is the default response to tap scrolling).
* Optional: Move the zoom buttons to the edge of the map (remove padding), remove legend and/or tooltips at hand held sizes. This is not a great solution, but occassionally necessary (particularly for legends that take up a lot of space).
