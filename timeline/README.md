Timelines
=========

Currently, the timeline is inputted rather brutally into the CMS using the map content type in the energy.gov Drupal CMS. You can see the existing example of it [at the map level](http://energy.gov/maps/history-lightbulb) and at the [article level](http://energy.gov/articles/history-light-bulb).

Find more documentation about timelines at the [timeline JS website](http://timeline.knightlab.com/)

In the future we are likely going to use the Timeline JS [drupal module](https://drupal.org/project/views_timelinejs) which will allow us to create a timeline without needing to individually create json files.
